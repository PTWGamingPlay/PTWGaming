Introduction
Play to Win Gaming (PTWG) is a play-to-earn ecosystem based in Birmingham, England, that welcomes players from all regions where cryptocurrency is permitted. Players are rewarded with PTWG, the community-driven token powering our gaming universe. The ecosystem is designed to ensure sustainability, engagement, and long-term growth through a structured liquidity removal and allocation process.

Liquidity Allocation Breakdown
To maintain transparency and sustainability, liquidity will be removed in phases and allocated as follows:

30% – Player Rewards
A significant portion of the removed liquidity will be redistributed to players through in-game rewards. Players can earn PTWG by completing objectives, winning challenges, or participating in special events. These rewards will be directly transferred to their wallets via smart contracts, reinforcing PTWG’s play-to-earn model.

25% – Development
To ensure continued growth and innovation, 25% of the liquidity removed will be allocated to game development. This includes:

Expanding existing games
Developing new play-to-earn experiences
Enhancing blockchain integration
Improving security and scalability
20% – Liquidity Pool
A portion of the removed liquidity will be reallocated back into the liquidity pool to maintain price stability, minimize volatility, and support healthy trading activity. This ensures long-term sustainability and accessibility for new and existing users.

15% – Marketing & Community Growth
To expand PTWG’s reach and build a strong community, 15% of the removed liquidity will be dedicated to:

Advertising campaigns
Influencer partnerships
Community engagement programs
Hosting events and tournaments
10% – Team & Operations
The final 10% will be used to support the core team behind PTWG, ensuring continued development, strategic planning, and operational efficiency. This covers salaries, legal expenses, and other necessary business functions to keep the project running smoothly.

Commitment to Transparency
Transparency is at the heart of PTWG. The community will receive regular updates on liquidity removals and allocations to ensure clarity and trust in the project. All transactions related to liquidity usage will be verifiable on the blockchain.
